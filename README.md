# 💫 About Me
Hey there! I'm Abdulrahman Iskandar, a detail-oriented and innovative recent bachelor’s graduate with a passion for web and mobile development. My journey into the world of technology began at Jazan University, where I pursued a B.A. in Information Technology.<br>During my academic journey, I delved deep into iOS app development, honing my skills in Swift and Swift UI. I've had the pleasure of building multiple applications, including a Food Recipe Application using Swift UI on Xcode, where I implemented various features to deliver a seamless user experience.<br>Apart from iOS development, I'm also keen on exploring web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native for cross-platform development. I strongly believe in the power of staying updated with the latest technologies to deliver high-quality applications.<br>When I'm not coding, you can find me seeking new challenges, solving problems, and expanding my horizons. Let's connect on LinkedIn and explore exciting opportunities together!
